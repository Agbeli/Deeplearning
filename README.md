# Deeplearning
Practical of Deep learning 

- This repository is a sample deeplearning implementation using python. 
## First Course entitles:

- In the course, I understood the concept of forward propagation ad backward propagation. From there, I implemented the forward propagation and backward propagation in python using the numpy package. 


- Implementation of logistic regression classifying cats images. [Logistics](Logistic+Regression+with+a+Neural+Network+mindset+v5 .ipynb) 

- Implementation of hidden layers with different activation function. [Method](Planar+data+classification+with+one+hidden+layer+v5.ipynb) 

- After that I had to after that I had to use deep neural on the same datasets and compare the two algorithms. [algorithm](Building+your+Deep+Neural+Network+-+Step+by+Step+v8.ipynb)

## Results: 

- The Deep neural network algorithm gives a better accuracy than the logistics regression in classifying the image datasets.
