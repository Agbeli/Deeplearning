# Deeplearning
Practical of Deep learning 

- This repository is a sample deeplearning implementation using python. 
## First Course entitles:

- In the course, I understood the concept of forward propagation ad backward propagation. From there, I implemented the forward propagation and backward propagation in python using the numpy package. 


- Implementation of logistic regression classifying cats images. [Logistics](Logistic+Regression+with+a+Neural+Network+mindset+v5.ipynb) 

- Implementation of hidden layers with different activation function. [Method](Planar+data+classification+with+one+hidden+layer+v5.ipynb) 

- After that I had to after that I had to use deep neural on the same datasets and compare the two algorithms. [algorithm](Building+your+Deep+Neural+Network+-+Step+by+Step+v8.ipynb)

- Final built a complete deep learning model by combining the forward and backward propagation. [Model](Deep+Neural+Network+-+Application+v8.ipynb)

## Results: 

- The Deep neural network algorithm gives a better accuracy than the logistics regression in classifying the image datasets. 


## The second course entitles:

- The different type of optimization methods. They are:

- Gradient descents algorithm 
- Stochastic Gradient descent: Batch = 1
- Mini-batch gradient descent.
- Gradient descent with momentum 
- RMSprop algorithm
- Adam algorithm which involve both Gradient descent with momentum and RMSprop.

- I had the chance to implement regularization methods to control bias-variance errors. This was done by using the fibonius distance. [Methods](Regularization+-+v2.html)

This can be located [here](Optimization+methods.ipynb) 

- Lastly, In the I implement a deeplearning model by using one of the deeplearning framework Tensorflow. [here](Tensorflow+Tutorial.ipynb)
